# Fixing issues with `SameSite` cookies and 3-D Secure checkout flows

3-D Secure is a verification service for card payments taken online. From the
point of view of a user or site, the flow generally looks like this:

- User enters their payment details on the site’s checkout;
- Site embeds or redirects to the appropriate page to verify that payment method
  (dependent on the user’s card, e.g. Visa, Amex, etc.);
- Third-party does its verification (via SMS or similar);
- Third-party returns the status to the main site, generally via a `POST`
  request.

The 3-D Secure interface may be displayed to the user in a number of different
ways: an iframe in the page, a pop-up, or a full page redirect. The common
pattern with all of these is a cross-site `POST` request initiated at the end of
the 3-D Secure verification back to the original site. This is what causes a
challenge with the recent updates to apply a `SameSite=Lax` by default behaviour
to cookies without a `SameSite` value. In other words, **cookies without a
`SameSite` attribute will not be included on the 3-D Secure `POST` callback**.

This means that final `POST` request may appear to your server as a new session,
meaning your site may attempt to set new cookies for the user or treat them as
if they were not logged in.

There are a number of options to fix this based on your site's archicture.

## Do not require cookies on the returning `POST` request

Generally, the cookies on your site for maintaining the user's session are only
intended for first-party use. You do not want them sent on cross-site requests
as this loses the security benefits of implementing `SameSite=Lax` by default,
e.g. it makes Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks easier.

Check if you are able to process the returning `POST` request without the need
for any of your session cookies. For example, if the 3-D Secure challenge was
included in an `iframe` then you may only need to display a status message
within the frame while sending a `postmessage()` call to your top-level window
to complete the transaction.

If the returning `POST` request is a top-level navigation / redirect and you
would like to display session-specific content to the user, then you may want to
consider the
[`POST`/Redirect/`GET` pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get).
That is:

- Process the incoming `POST` request without cookies recording any results you
  need in the back-end
- Respond with a `303` redirect to an internal page for the result of the
  transaction, e.g. `/transaction/123/success` or similar.
- The subsequent `GET` request is considered a "safe" method and will include
  any `SameSite=Lax` cookies.

This means that the redirected request will include your sites first-party
cookies and can be used to display session-specific content.

## Create short-lived, cross-site cookies for the returning `POST` request

If you do need cookies on the returning `POST` request, they need to be marked
with the `SameSite=None; Secure` attributes. You should not make your default
session cookies available to third-parties, so instead consider creating a
short-lived cookie that stores a token that allows you to link the incoming
`POST` request to the associated user or transaction on your back-end.

This flow might look like:

- Create a short-lived (e.g. 15 minutes) cookie that will enable you to identify
  the transaction:
  `Set-Cookie: transaction-token=abc123abc; SameSite=None; Secure; Max-Age=900`
- Check the `Origin` or `Referer` header on the returning `POST` request to
  ensure it matches the expected source.
- Use the token to initialise the existing session.
- Mark the token as used in your back-end to ensure it is not used again.
