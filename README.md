## üí° Upcoming deprecation of third-party cookies

Now that support for `SameSite=None` has been deployed across the web, the next step is restricting third-party cookies by default. If you added `SameSite=None` to any of your cookies, then you will now need to take further action to migrate or maintain that functionality.

**See the [Third-party cookie deprecation section in the Privacy Sandbox developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd).**

This is a companion repo for the
["`SameSite` cookies explained"](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained)
article on web.dev. This is your starting point for how cookies work, the
functionality of the `SameSite` attribute, and the changes in Chrome to apply a
`SameSite=Lax` policy by default while requiring the use of
`SameSite=None; Secure` for cookies in a third-party context.

This functionality is available now in
[Chrome 76](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule) behind the
associated flags to let you test the effect on your site. This is intended to
become default behaviour as of Chrome 80.

## `SameSite=Lax` by default

- Flag: `chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies`
- Chrome Status entry:
  [Cookies with `SameSite` by default](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592)

Turn this flag on to have Chrome apply the equivalent of `SameSite=Lax` to
cookies without a `SameSite` attribute specified.

## Require `Secure` with `SameSite=None`

- Flag: `chrome://flags/#cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure`
- Chrome Status entry:
  [Reject insecure `SameSite=None` cookies](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032)

Turn on this flag along with the previous flag to have Chrome enforce the need
for any `SameSite=None` cookie to also specify the `Secure` attribute.

## See affected cookies

- Flag `chrome://flags/#cookie-deprecation-messages`

This will add console warning messages for _every single cookie_ potentially
affected by this change.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** You will see a lot of messages! Seriously, a lot of messages.

Since the vast majority of cookies do not have any `SameSite` attribute set that
means they are all sent in a cross-site context, regardless of whether or not
the intent is to use them.

As you add the correct `SameSite` and `Secure` values to your cookies, you will
be able to use the console warnings to test for any you have missed. Try this
without the previous flags enabled.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Examples

In this repo you'll find examples on making use of `SameSite=None; Secure` in a
variety of languages, libraries, and frameworks. The `SameSite` attribute is
widely supported, but the addition of the explicit `None` value may require
updates or work-arounds.

**üöß NOTE:** To test the `None` value is set you need to test in a browser that
parses this addition, e.g. Chrome 76 or above. The changes _should_ be backwards
compatible, but those browsers should ignore the `None` value so you will not
see it in any cookie view.
